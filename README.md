PainC, pain management - that patients with chronic pain can access to better track their pain and mood states. It provides both pain and mood metrics that can be used by their healthcare providers to better understand pain management. A key part of the app allows patients to capture daily self-reported measures that can include pain (visual analog scale), mood (PANAS), activity (e.g., walking, sleeping), and wellness (e.g., General life, mindfulness) metrics. This information is then seamlessly uploaded to the care team to streamline the care process with an easy-to-use dashboard.
